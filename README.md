It's not even possible to explain how many years I've been trying to sit down and write a decent compound document fuzzer. Everytime I do, something explodes in my life.
That's what this was about, I think the physical reverberations got significant enough that I spazzed out about concerns of piracy and lost access to Office ... for like 3 or 4 years.

The signs of a beginning arc is unfounded success, its because it makes you fight harder and more compliant when its taken away. You eventually arrive at a point where things like a t-shirt are these things you're grateful to have. 

Accenture, Accuvant, Medsec, Altredis, etc all look like the beginning of arcs. It's a multi-year process. You have to understand, whoever they is, they ONLY care about control.
